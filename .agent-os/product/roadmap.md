# Product Roadmap

> Last Updated: 2025-08-25
> Version: 1.0.0
> Status: In Development

## Phase 0: Already Completed

The following features have been implemented in the prototype:

- [x] **Core Engine Architecture** - Thread-safe ProjectIndex with concurrent file processing
- [x] **Language Adapter System** - Plugin-based architecture for multiple language support
- [x] **Tree-sitter Integration** - Complete integration with tree-sitter parsers
- [x] **Multi-language Support** - Adapters for Go, TypeScript, Python, and Ruby
- [x] **Symbol Extraction** - S-expression queries (.scm files) for definitions, references, and imports
- [x] **"Go to Definition"** - Symbol resolution and cursor-based definition lookup
- [x] **Concurrent Processing** - 4-worker concurrent file indexing for performance
- [x] **Demo Application** - Working demo showing basic functionality (cmd/demo/main.go)
- [x] **Directory Traversal** - Automatic discovery and indexing of source files

## Phase 1: Python Foundation & Accuracy (4-6 weeks)

**Goal:** Focus exclusively on Python accuracy and stability before expanding to other languages
**Success Criteria:** Rock-solid Python parsing with comprehensive test suite and proven accuracy

### Must-Have Features

- [ ] **Python Accuracy Improvements**: Refine existing Python .scm queries for better precision
- [ ] **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Extensive test coverage across real-world Python codebases
- [ ] **Edge Case Handling**: Handle Python-specific patterns (decorators, async/await, etc.)
- [ ] **Performance Benchmarks**: Establish baseline performance metrics for Python parsing
- [ ] **Validation Framework**: Automated testing against known Python projects

## Phase 2: Multi-Language Stability (3-4 weeks)

**Goal:** Ensure reliable operation across Go, TypeScript, and Python with consistent API
**Success Criteria:** Unified interface working seamlessly across all three supported languages

### Must-Have Features

- **Unified Language Interface**: Consistent API across all language adapters
- **Cross-Language Testing**: Test suite covering mixed-language codebases
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for malformed or edge-case source files
- **Performance Optimization**: Concurrent processing optimizations for large codebases
- **Memory Management**: Efficient memory usage patterns for long-running processes

## Phase 3: Developer Experience (2-3 weeks)

**Goal:** Polish the developer experience and integration patterns
**Success Criteria:** Easy integration into existing toolchains with clear documentation

### Must-Have Features

- **API Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation with usage examples
- **Integration Examples**: Sample integrations for common use cases (IDE plugins, CI/CD)
- **CLI Enhancements**: Improved demo application with better output formatting
- **Configuration Options**: Flexible configuration for different use cases
- **Error Messages**: Clear, actionable error messages for debugging

## Phase 4: Future Language Expansion (Ongoing)

**Goal:** Expand language support based on community needs and adoption
**Success Criteria:** Successful addition of new languages without breaking existing functionality

### Potential Languages

- **JavaScript/ECMAScript**: Native JavaScript support beyond TypeScript
- **Rust**: Systems programming language support
- **Java**: Enterprise language support
- **C/C++**: Systems programming support
