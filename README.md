# xref

This is a cross-reference engine for code analysis that:

- Indexes codebases using tree-sitter parsers for multiple languages (Go, TypeScript, Python)
- Finds definitions of symbols at specific cursor positions
- Tracks references to symbols across files
- Extracts semantic information like function definitions, imports, and variable declarations
- Provides a unified API for code navigation across different programming languages
